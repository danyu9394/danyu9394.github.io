Hello! My name is Danyu.

I am originally from Suzhou, China. I studied Electrical Engineering for 6 years and now I am an application engineer lives in silicon valley.

I am passionate in the field of embedded system, FPGA design. I also have extensive high-speed digital signal circuit design(MIPI, DVP, LVDS) and debug experience. My focus right now is on writing camera drivers, bridging modules for different interfaces and corresponding camera applications for user defined functionality testing and image signal processing.
